# Wideband-Amplifier-with-AGC-By-Designing-Implementing-PCB
Designed and implemented a 40 dB wideband amplifier (200 kHz–2 MHz) with an automatic gain control (AGC) circuit using LTSpice and DipTrace. Developed the PCB under specified design and budget constraints, assembled the components, and validated performance through laboratory measurements.
