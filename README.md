# Wideband-Amplifier-with-AGC-By-Designing-Implementing-PCB


A 40 dB wideband amplifier operating between 200 kHz and 2 MHz, designed using two BC238 BJTs and an automatic gain control (AGC) circuit.

## Project Overview
The amplifier was designed to:
- Deliver Voutp = 1 ± 0.1 V
- Operate across 200 kHz – 2 MHz
- Maintain ICC < 100 mA
- Drive an LED indicator based on output peak level

The design was simulated in LTSpice, implemented on a custom PCB designed in DipTrace, assembled manually, and experimentally validated in laboratory conditions.

## Key Results
- Stable 1 V peak output across frequency band
- Power supply current ≈ 32 mA (< 100 mA requirement)
- LED control validated based on output amplitude threshold

## Tools Used
- LTSpice (Circuit Simulation)
- DipTrace (PCB Design)
- Oscilloscope & Signal Generator (Experimental Verification)
